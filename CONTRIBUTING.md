# Requirements

Make a folder for the Programming Language you are using if there isn't already one. Make sure your code is correct too. Then, make a file that is `problem-name.file_extension`. So, for example, if I had a solution for <a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/2048">2048</a> in Python, then I would make `2048.py`.
