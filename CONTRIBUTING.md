# Contributing

To contribute, simply make a pull request.

# Requirements

Make a folder for the Programming Language you are using if there isn't already one. Make sure your code is correct too. Then, make a file that is `problem-name.file_extension`. So, for example, if I had a solution for <a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/2048">2048</a> in Python, then I would make `2048.py`. (The name is the text that goes after "`https://dmoj.ca/problem/`" so if my url was `https://dmoj.ca/problem/my-very-cool-problem`, then I would write a C++ solution named `my-very-cool-problem.cpp`. Make sure to put your file in the correct directory (folder)!!!

# What To Do

When contributing, you can either add a new problem or complete an already existing one (denoted by a comment saying `not yet completed`). There are also some issues you can solve.

<h3>Good Luck!</h3>
